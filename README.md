This is a new trick for create 2d cloud in Unity or other game engine.

Code write on URP 12.1.7 (Unity 2021) , but shader is not complicate so you can use this shader on lower version of URP without any error, maybe.

# Here we can get 4 folders insides.
1: Model: M_Hemisphere_Inv_Normal.fbx, a hemisphere which has invere normal

2: Textures: 4 textures for 2 types of clouds.

3: Material: 2 materials for 2 types of clouds.

4: Shaders: CloudLayer.shader and CloudLayer.hlsl

5: BlenderFile: a scene which ease to use for render six-way cloud
